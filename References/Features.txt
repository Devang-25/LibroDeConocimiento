   Add unordered_set[11,12,22,32,42,43] and just search all with subset of it if is present already
   If it is present, store it for now as a terminated path since somebody is already traversing it
   In the end, all that reached the goal should be searched of all that has been stored, add 1 for each
   Goal is so that no need to redo searching the same path
